# Task 2 â€“ 2-Link Inverse Kinematics  
Author: **Sani Jonathan Enemona**

---

## í³Œ What I Did
1. **Cloned the repository** using SSH and navigated into the project.  
2. **Created my own task folder** under `tasks/Task-2/SaniJonathan`.  
3. **Copied the provided file** `2_links_2d.py` from the source codes into my folder.  
4. **Renamed the file** to `sani-jonathan-2_links_2d.py`.  
5. **Commented the entire code thoroughly** in a tutorial style â€“ explaining every line, math, and visualization step.  
6. **Tested the code interactively** by clicking on the plot to check different reachable/unreachable targets.

##  What I Learned
- **Inverse Kinematics (IK):**  
  - How to use the **law of cosines** to calculate joint angles from a target point.  
  - The concept of **two solutions** for planar arms: *elbow-up* and *elbow-down*.  
  - How reachability depends on the arm length boundaries (inside inner circle or outside outer circle = unreachable).

##  Insights & Reflections
- The exercise helped me connect **theory (IK equations)** with **practical visualization**.  
- I now understand why robotics simulations always give *two possible poses* for a 2-link manipulator.  
- By commenting every line, I forced myself to slow down and **truly digest the math + code flow**.  
- I realized the importance of **interactive tools** in robotics learning â€“ clicking to see arm movement feels much clearer than just reading equations.

## íº€ Possible Extensions
- Add error handling for out-of-bound clicks with more descriptive feedback.
