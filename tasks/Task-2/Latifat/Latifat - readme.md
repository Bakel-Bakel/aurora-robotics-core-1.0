1. I installed VS code from my terminal (checked how to do that on YouTube),
2. Installed the python and C++ extensions from the vscode extensions
3. I installed python 3-pip using the following command
4. sudo apt install python3-pip
5. Then I proceeded to installing numpy and matplotlib
6. Installations all together:
    a.  VS COde
    b.  Python latest Version
    c.  Python3-pip
    e.  numpy
    f.  matplotlib

Then I proceeded to looking at the python document that has the FK analysis to dissect every line of code according to what was thought in class. Involves:
1.  Resolving the link1 and link2 into their horizontal and vertical components
2.  Declaring all variables theta(rotation and translation angles in radians), L (link lenghts in whatever unit)
3.
