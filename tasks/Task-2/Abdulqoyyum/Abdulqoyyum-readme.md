In this particular class, I learned more about kinematics in robotics which is used to describe the motion of a robot without considering the force that causes it
Majorly, we can have inverse kinematics and forward kinematics
Forward kinematics: Let us think about it this way
If the angle and length of a robotic arm were to be predefined, where does the end effector-the main part that takes action (like hand in human arm) will be in space
Inverse kinematics in the reverse case
If we know the point th end effector should be, what angle and length do we need to set to achieve this
This is more hard to solve than forward kinematics because there could be multiple ways to reach a point
After getting the concept, now is the time for the math
Why? The robot softwares do not understand the physical form of a robot, the code works basically on some mathematical expressions
infact, simulation is purely built on maths
The math is done before moving to the code
Extensive comments has been done on the code for two links in 2-dimensional
At the end, I understood how we translate concept-math-code-application
